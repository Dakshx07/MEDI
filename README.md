## Medi Chain - AI + Blockchain Prescription Verification System

Project Overview
Medi Chain is an innovative platform that combines AI and blockchain technology to digitize, verify, and securely store medical prescriptions. Designed to combat prescription fraud, drug abuse, and traceability issues, especially in low-resource areas like India's Tier-2/Tier-3 cities and rural clinics, it offers a tamper-proof, offline-friendly solution. Doctors can generate prescriptions, pharmacists can upload and verify them, and regulators can audit recordsâ€”all with minimal workflow disruption.
